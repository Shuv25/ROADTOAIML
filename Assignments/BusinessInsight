1. Customer Distribution by Region

Fewer clients are found in Asia and other locations, with the majority of customers being in South America and Europe.

This implies that the company can concentrate its targeted marketing efforts more on South America and Europe while looking at development prospects in Asia.

2. Top-Selling Product Categories

Electronics leads in sales and makes up the largest portion of total revenue.

To increase sales even more, the company can think about adding more products to the Electronics area and using this category for focused marketing campaigns.

3. Sales by Month

Q4 (Octoberâ€“December) is when most client signups and transactions take place.

This suggests that there might be a time of high demand around the end of the year, most likely as a result of holiday shopping. During this time, businesses should budget for more inventory and promotions.

4. Quantity and Total Sales Correlation

High-value products (like electronics) may be bought in smaller numbers but generate more overall revenue because larger quantities do not always translate into noticeably greater total sales values.

Even if sales volumes stay lower, concentrating on growing the sale of high-end, valuable products will contribute to total revenue growth.

5. Region-Based Sales Performance

South America and Europe account for a sizable portion of total sales, especially in the book and electronics sectors.

The company might modify its regional marketing plans to concentrate on local demand patterns and look at chances to grow into unexplored markets like Asia or North America.
